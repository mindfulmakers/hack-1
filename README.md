# Mindfulness Hack: EEG (Mindful Makers x Neurable)

## Picking an idea
- The idea of Mindful Makers is that we are building spiritual, mindful, or meditative technology that *we ourselves can try out*.  Themes related to spirituality, mindfulness, meditation, and introspection can include:
  - New kinds of meditation experiences
  - Healthy social connectedness
  - Spirituality/religious practices and traditions
  - Proactive rather than reactive living (e.g. by filtering of certain daily stimuli/content)
  - Creations that amplify behavioral or biometric self-awareness.
  - Emotional reframing, nostalgia, humor
  - Gratitude, other practices related to psychology of well-being 
 
Topics to avoid, at least for today: Ideas related to psychedelics/other drugs. Productivity tools. Generic social media without a spiritual/contemplative purpose or lens. Ideas surrounding topics that are too heavy (e.g. for emergency mental health crises). Tools and products that wouldn't be testable by at least some members of the group.
 
### Do we have to use Neurable/EEG?
You do not have to use Neurable or EEG.  But feel free to see how using your creation affects your brain!

## Making a mindfulness product

### General advice
- Divide up work well
- Don't be too ambitious - build something small that works first

### Non-coder toolset and advice
- Start with Lovable for web-based ideas. For everything else:
- Make a Github account
- Download: Cursor, Github Desktop
- Ask for help from organizers!

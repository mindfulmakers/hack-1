Mindfulness Hack: EEG (Mindful Makers x Neurable)

## Picking an idea
- The idea of Mindful Makers is that we are building spiritual, mindful, or meditative technology that *we ourselves can try out*.  Themes related to spirituality, mindfulness, meditation, and introspection:
  - Meditation audio or video based on sensors
  - Healthy social connectedness
  - Spirituality/religious practices and traditions
  - Filtering of content to allow for proactive rather than reactive living
  - Creations that amplify behavioral or biometric self-awareness.
 
Topics to avoid: Ideas related to psychedelics/other drugs. Productivity tools. Generic social media without a spiritual/contemplative purpose or lens. Ideas surrounding topics that are too heavy like emergency mental health crises. Tools and products that wouldn't be testable by at least some members of the group.
 
### Do we have to use Neurable/EEG?
You do not have to use Neurable or EEG.  But feel free to see how using your creation affects your brain!

## Picking a team
- Non-coders should consider forming teams together and learning together.  Help will be available!  Sometimes this avoids situations of one person having nothing to do while others in the group are busy coding.
